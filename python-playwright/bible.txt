Hoseas Wife and Children

The word of the LORD which came to Hosea the son of Beeri during the
days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and
during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel

When the LORD first spoke through Hosea the LORD said to Hosea Go
take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry for the
land commits flagrant harlotry forsaking the LORD

3So0 he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim and she conceived
and bore him a son

4And the LORD said to him Name him Jezreel for yet a little while and
ST will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel and I will
put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel

On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel
Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter And the LORD said
to him Name her Loruhamah for I will no longer have compassion on
the house of Israel that I would ever forgive them

But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by
the LORD their God and will not deliver them by bow sword battle
horses or horsemen

8When she had weaned Loruhamah she conceived and gave birth to a son

And the LORD said Name him JLoammi for I do not consider you not
My people and I will not serve as not your God
Vet the number of the sons of Israel
Will resemble the sand of the sea
Which no one cannot measure or number
And in the place
Where I said to them
T do not consider You My people
I will say to them
T consider you the sons of the living God
4and the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel gather together
And they will appoint for themselves one leader
And they will go up from the land
For great will we consider the day of Jezreel

Hosea 2

NASB EPrime DFM

Israels Unfaithfulness Condemned

4Say to your brothers Ammi and to your sisters Ruhamah
2Contend with your mother contend
For she does not behave like my wife and I do not consider myself
her husband
And let her put away her harlotry from her face
And her adultery from between her breasts
3Or I will strip her naked
And expose her as on the day when she came into the world
I will also make her like a wilderness
Make her like desert land
And slay her with thirst
Also I will have no compassion on her children
Because they show themselves as children of harlotry
For their mother has played the harlot
She who conceived them has acted shamefully
For she said I will go after my lovers
Who give me my bread and my water
My wool and my flax my oil and my drink
STherefore behold I will hedge up her way with thorns
And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths
She will pursue her lovers but she will not overtake them
And she will seek them but will not find them
Then she will say 21 will go back to my first husband
For I had it better then than now
SFor she does not know that I gave her the grain the new wine and
the oil
And lavished on her silver and gold
Which they used for Baal
Therefore I will take back My grain at harvest time
And My new wine in its season
I will also take away My wool and My flax
Given to cover her nakedness
10 And then I will uncover her lewdness
In the sight of her lovers
And no one will rescue her out of My hand
1157 will also put an end to all her gaiety
Her feasts her new moons her sabbaths
And all her festal assemblies
12uT will destroy her vines and fig trees
Of which she said These I consider my wages
Which my lovers have given me 
And I will make them a forest
And the beasts of the field will devour them
3T will punish her for the days of the Baals
When she used to offer sacrifices to them
And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry
And follow her lovers so that she 422Forgot Me declares the LORD

Restoration of Israel

14Therefore behold I will allure her
Bring her into the wilderness
And speak kindly to her

SThen I will give her vineyards from there
And the valley of Achor as a door of hope
And she will 4sing there as in the days of her youth
As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt
16Tt will come about in that day declares the LORD
That you will call Me 4 Ishi
And will no longer call Me Baali
17For ANT will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth
So that you will mention their names no more
8Th that day I will also make a covenant for them
With the beasts of the field
The birds of the sky
And the creeping things of the ground
And I will abolish the bow the sword and war from the land
And will make them lie down in safety
1SuT will betroth you to Me forever
Yes I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice
In lovingkindness and in compassion
2and I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness
Then you will know the LORD
Tt will come about in that day that I will respond declares the
LORD
I will respond to the heavens and they will respond to the earth
22and the earth will respond to the grain to the new wine and to the
oil
And they will respond to Jezreel
23 will sow her for Myself in the land
4T will also have compassion on her who had not obtained
compassion
And J will say to those who previously I considered My people
IT consider You My people
And they will say I acknowledge You as my God

Hoseas Second Symbolic Marriage
Then the LORD said to me Go again love a woman whose husband loves
her yet an adulteress even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel though
they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes

2So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a
half of barley

3Then I said to her You shall stay with me for many days You shall not
play the harlot nor shall you have a man so I will also honor you

For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince
without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without Yephod or household
idols

Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and
David their king and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His
goodness in the last days

Gods Controversy with Israel

14listen to the word of the LORD O sons of Israel
For the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land
Because no faithfulness or kindness exists
Or knowledge of God in the land
we see swearing deception murder stealing and adultery
They employ violence so that bloodshed follows bloodshed
3Therefore the land mourns
And everyone who lives in it languishes
Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky
And also the fish of the sea disappear
4Yet let no one find fault and let none offer reproof
For your people compare to those who contend with the priest
So you will stumble by day

And the prophet also will stumble with you by night

And I will destroy your mother

Sy people have destroyed themselves for lack of knowledge

Because you have rejected knowledge

I also will reject you from serving as My priest

Since you have forgotten the law of your God

I also will forget your children

The more they multiplied the more they sinned against Me

I will change their glory into shame

SThey feed on the sin of My people

And direct their desire toward their iniquity
And it will come to pass like people like priest

So I will punish them for their ways

And repay them for their deeds

1044 They will eat but not have enough

They will 4play the harlot but not increase

Because they have stopped giving heed to the LORD
1Harlotry 42wine and new wine take away the understanding
2my people consult their wooden idol and their diviners wand informs

them

For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray

And they have played the harlot departing from their God
3They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains

And burn incense on the hills

44 Under oak poplar and terebinth

Because their shade seems pleasant

Therefore your daughters play the harlot

And your brides commit adultery

147 will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot

Or your brides when they commit adultery

For the men themselves go apart with harlots

And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes

So the people without understanding ruin themselves
Though you Israel play the harlot

Do not let Judah become guilty

Also do not go to Gilgal
Or go up to Bethaven
And take the oath
As the LORD lives
6Since Israel has proved herself stubborn
Like a stubborn heifer
Can the LORD now pasture them
Like a lamb in a large field
7Ephraim joins herself to idols
41 et him alone
8Their liquor gone
They play the harlot continually
Their rulers dearly love shame
942The wind wraps them in its wings
And they will feel shame because of their sacrifices

Hosea 5

NASB EPrime DFM
The Peoples Apostasy Rebuked

Hear this O priests
Give heed O house of Israel
Listen O house of the king
For the judgment applies to you
For you have made yourselves a snare at Mizpah
And a net spread out on Tabor
The rebels have gone deep in depravity
But I will chastise all of them

31 know Ephraim and Israel cannot hide from Me
For now O Ephraim you have played the harlot
Israel has defiled itself

Their deeds will not allow them
To return to their God
For a spirit of harlotry dwells within them
And they do not know the LORD
Moreover the pride of Israel testifies against him
And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity
Judah also has stumbled with them
SThey will go with their flocks and herds
To seek the LORD but they will not find Him
He has withdrawn from them
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD
For they have borne illegitimate children
Now the new moon will devour them with their land
8Blow the horn in Gibeah
The trumpet in Ramah
Sound an alarm at Bethaven
Behind you Benjamin
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke
Among the tribes of Israel I declare what I know as sure
The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary
On them I will pour out My wrath like water
1Ephraim is oppressed crushed in judgment
Because he felt determined to follow mans command
12Therefore I resemble a moth to Ephraim
And like rottenness to the house of Judah
13When Ephraim saw his sickness
And Judah his wound
Then Ephraim went to Assyria
And sent to King Jareb
But he cannot heal you
Or to cure you of your wound
4Eor I will resemble a lion to Ephraim
And like a young lion to the house of Judah
42 even I will tear to pieces and go away
I will carry away and none will deliver
ST will go away and return to My place
Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face
In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me

The Response to Gods Rebuke

1ACome let us return to the LORD
For He has torn us but He will heal us
He has wounded us but He will bandage us
He will revive us after two days
He will raise us up on the third day
That we may live before Him
3So let us know let us press on to know the LORD
His going forth we acknowledge as certain as the dawn
And He will come to us like the rain
Like the spring rain watering the earth
What shall I do with you O Ephraim
What shall I do with you O Judah
For your loyalty resembles a morning cloud
And like the dew which goes away early
Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets
I have slain them by the words of My mouth
And the judgments on you resemble the light that goes forth
SFor I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice
And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings
7But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant
There they have dealt treacherously against Me
8SGilead proves herself a city of wrongdoers
Tracked with bloody footprints
And as raiders wait for a man
So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem
Surely they have committed crime
Th the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing
Ephraims harlotry appears there Israel has defiled itself
11Also O Judah I appoint a harvest for you
When I restore the fortunes of My people
Hosea 7

Ephraims Iniquity

When I would heal Israel
The iniquity of Ephraim shall become uncovered
And the evil deeds of Samaria
For they deal falsely
The thief enters in
Bandits raid outside
And they do not consider in their hearts
That I remember all their wickedness
Now their deeds appear all around them
They appear before My face
swith their wickedness they make the king glad
And the princes with their lies
They all prove themselves adulterers
Like an oven heated by the baker
Who ceases to stir up the fire
From the kneading of the dough until it becomes leavened
On the day of our king the princes became sick with the heat of wine
He stretched out his hand with scoffers
For their hearts resemble an oven
As they approach their plotting
Their anger smolders all night
In the morning it burns like a flaming fire
7All of them seem hot like an oven
And they consume their rulers
All their kings have fallen
None of them calls on Me
SEphraim 2mixes himself with the nations
Ephraim has become a cake not turned
Strangers devour his strength
Yet he does not know it
Gray hairs also have become sprinkled on him
Yet he does not know it
Though the pride of Israel testifies against him
Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God
Nor have they sought Him for all this
11S9 MEphraim has become like a silly dove without sense
They call to Egypt they go to Assyria
2wWhen they go I will spread My net over them
I will bring them down like the birds of the sky
I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their
assembly
132 Woe to them for they have strayed from Me
Destruction has become theirs for they have rebelled against Me
I 2would redeem them but they speak lies against Me
and they do not cry to Me from their heart
When they wail on their beds
For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves
They turn away from Me
SAlthough I trained and strengthened their arms
Yet they devise evil against Me
16They turn but not upward
They resemble a 4deceitful bow
Their princes will fall by the sword
Because of the insolence of their tongue
This will constitute their derision in the land of Egypt

Israel Reaps the Whirlwind

Aput the trumpet to your lips
ike an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the LORD
Because they have transgressed My covenant
And rebelled against My law
2 They cry out to Me
My God we of Israel know You
3Israel has rejected the good
The enemy will pursue him
They have set up kings but not by Me
They have appointed princes but I did not know it
With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves
That they might cut themselves off
He has rejected your calf O Samaria saying
My anger burns against them
How long will they show incapability of innocence
For from Israel comes even this
A craftsman made it so we cannot call it God
Surely the calf of Samaria will break to pieces
7For they sow the wind
And they reap the whirlwind
The standing grain has no heads
It yields no grain
Should it yield strangers would swallow it up
Israel has becomeswallowed up
They now find themselves among the nations
Like a vessel in which no one delights
For they have gone up to Assyria
Like a wild donkey all alone
Ephraim has hired lovers
0F ven though they hire allies among the nations
Now I will Wgather them up
And they will begin to diminish
Because of the burden of the king of princes
ISince Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin
They have become altars of sinning for him
Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law
They treat them as a strange thing
13s for My sacrificial gifts
They sacrifice the flesh and eat it
But the LORD has taken no delight in them
Now He will remember their iniquity
And 2punish them for their sins
They will return to Egypt
4For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces
And Judah has multiplied fortified cities
But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial
dwellings

Ephraim Punished

1ADo not rejoice O Israel with exultation like the nations
For you have played the harlot forsaking your God
You have loved harlots earnings on every threshing floor
Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them
And the new wine will fail them
3They will not remain in the LORDS land
But Ephraim will return to Egypt
And in Assyria they will eat unclean food
They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD
Their sacrifices will not please Him
Their bread will resemble mourners bread
All who eat of it will defile themselves
For their bread they will consume for themselves alone
It will not enter the house of the LORD
what will you do on the day of the appointed festival
And on the day of the feast of the LORD
For behold they will go because of destruction
Egypt will gather them up Memphis will bury them
Weeds will take over their treasures of silver
Thorns will appear in their tents
The days of punishment have come
The days of retribution have come
Let Israel know this
The prophet shows himself a fool
The inspired man has dementia
Because of the grossness of your iniquity
And because your hostility has become great
SEphraim serves as a watchman with my God a prophet
Yet the snare of a bird catcher enters all his ways
And only hostility remains in the house of his God
They have gone deep in depravity
As in the days of Gibeah
He will remember their iniquity
He will punish their sins
1T found Israel like grapes in the wilderness
I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first
season
But they came to Baalpeor and devoted themselves to 2 shame
And they became as detestable as that which they loved
IAs for Ephraim their glory will fly away like a bird
No birth no pregnancy and no conception
2Though they bring up their children
Yet I will bereave them until not a man remains
Yes woe to them indeed when I depart from them
13Ephraim as I have seen
I have planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre
But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter
4Give them O LORDwhat will You give
Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts
SAll their evil appears at Gilgal
Indeed I came to hate them there
Because of the wickedness of their deeds
I will drive them out of My house
I will love them no more
All their princes have become rebels
164DEphraim has become stricken their root dries up
They will bear no fruit
Even though they bear children
I will slay the precious ones of their womb
7My God will cast them away
Because they have not listened to Him
And they will wander among the nations

Retribution for Israels Sin
Israel resembles a luxuriant vine
He produces fruit for himself
The more his fruit
The more altars he made
The richer his land
The better he made the sacred pillars
Their heart has become faithless
Now they must bear their guilt
The LORD will break down their altars
And destroy their sacred pillars
3Surely now they will say We have no king
For we do not revere the LORD
As for the king what can he do for us
They speak mere words
With worthless oaths they make covenants
And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the
field
The inhabitants of Samaria will fear
For the calf of Bethaven
Indeed its people will mourn for it
And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it
Over its glory since it has departed from it
The thing itself will become carried to Assyria
As tribute to King Jareb
Ephraim will become seized with shame
And Israel will have shame because of its own counsel
Samaria will cut herself off with her king
Like a stick on the surface of the water
SAlso the high places of Aven the sin of Israel will become
destroyed
Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars
Then they will say to the mountains
Cover us And to the hills Fall on us
From the days of Gibeah you have sinned O Israel
There they stand
Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in
Gibeah
0When I desire I will chastise them
And the peoples will gather against them
When they become entangled for their double guilt
Ephraim resembles a trained heifer that loves to thresh
But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke
I will harness Ephraim
Judah will plow Jacob will harrow for himself
1248Sow with a view to righteousness
Reap in accordance with kindness
Break up your fallow ground
For time has come to seek the LORD
Until He comes to rain righteousness on you
2Vou have plowed wickedness you have reaped injustice
You have eaten the fruit of lies
Because you have trusted in your way in your 0nUumerous warriors
4Therefore a tumult will arise among your people
And all your fortresses will suffer destruction
As Shalman destroyed Betharbel on the day of battle
When they dashed mothers in pieces with their children
SThus it will happen to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness
At dawn the king of Israel will become completely cut off

God Yearns over His People

When Israel grew up as a youth I loved him
And out of Egypt I called My son
The more they called them
The more they went from them
They kept sacrificing to the Baals
And burning incense to idols
3Yet I taught Ephraim to walk
I took them in My arms
But they did not know that I healed them
41 ied them with cords of a man with bonds of love
And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws
And I bent down and fed them
They will not return to the land of Egypt
But Assyriahe will serve as their king
Because they refused to return to Me
The sword will whirl against their cities
And will demolish their gate bars
And consume them because of their counsels
7So My people have become intent on turning from Me
Though they call them to the One on high
None at all exalts Him
8 How can I give you up O Ephraim
How can I surrender you O Israel
How can I make you like Admah
How can I treat you like Zeboiim
My heart turns over within Me
All My compassions have kindled
T will not execute My fierce anger
I will not destroy Ephraim again
For I proclaim myself as God and not man the Holy One in your
midst
And I will not come in wrath
10They will walk after the LORD
He will roar like a lion
Indeed He will roar
And His sons will come trembling from the west
I They will come trembling like birds from Egypt
And like doves from the land of Assyria
And I will settle them in their houses declares the LORD
2Ephraim surrounds Me with lies
And the house of Israel with deceit
Judah has become unruly against God
Even against the Holy One who has demonstrated faithfulness

Ephraim Reminded

Ephraim feeds on wind
And pursues the east wind continually
He multiplies lies and violence
Moreover he makes a covenant with Assyria
And oil becomes transported to Egypt
The LORD also has a dispute with Judah
And will punish Jacob according to his ways
He will repay him according to his deeds
3In the womb he took his brother by the heel
And in his maturity he contended with God
Yes he wrestled with the angel and prevailed
He wept and sought His favor
He found Him at Bethel
And there He spoke with us
SEven the LORD the God of hosts
We acknowledge the LORD as His name
STherefore return to your God
OObserve kindness and justice
And wait for your God continually
7A merchant in whose hands hold false balances
He loves to oppress
8And Ephraim said Surely I have become rich
I have found wealth for myself
In all my labors they will find in me
2No iniquity which would constitute sin
But I have served as the LORD your God since the land of Egypt
I will make you live in tents again
As in the days of the appointed festival
10T have also spoken to the prophets
And I gave numerous visions
And through the prophets I gave parables
1Does iniquity exist in Gilead
Surely they prove worthless
In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls
Yes their altars resemble the stone heaps
Beside the furrows of the field

2Mlow Jacob fled to the land of Aram
And Israel worked for a wife
And for a wife he kept sheep

3But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt
And a prophet kept him

4 Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger
So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him
And bring back his reproach to him

Ephraims Idolatry

Awhen Ephraim spoke people trembled
He exalted himself in Israel
But through Baal he did wrong and died
And now they sin more and more
And make for themselves molten images
Idols skillfully made from their silver
All of them the work of craftsmen
They say of them Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves
Therefore they will resemble the morning cloud
And like dew which soon disappears
Like chaff which blows away from the threshing floor
And like smoke from a chimney
Yet I have proclaimed myself the LORD your God
Since the land of Egypt
And you would not know any god except Me
For no savior exists besides Me
t cared for you in the wilderness
21m the land of drought
As they had their pasture they became satisfied
And having become satisfied their heart became proud
Therefore they forgot Me
7So I will resemble a lion to them
Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside
81 will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs
And I will tear open their chests
There I will also devour them like a lioness
As a wild beast would tear them
Your destruction has come O Israel
That you are against Me against your help
OWhere now has your king gone
That he may save you in all your cities
And your judges of whom you requested
Give me a king and princes
17 gave you a king in My anger
And took him away in My wrath
2The iniquity of Ephraim has become bound up
His sin he hasstored up
2The pains of 2 childbirth come upon him
He has not proved a wise son
For the time has not come that he should delay at the opening of
the womb
4Shall I 4ransom them from the power of Sheol
Shall I redeem them from death
4 Death where do we see your thorns
O Sheol where do we feel your sting
Compassion will hide from My sight
SThough he flourishes among the reeds
An east wind will come
The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness
And his fountain will 4 become dry
And his spring will dry up
It will  plunder his treasury of every precious article
16Samaria will prove herself 4guilty
For she has rebelled against her God
PThey will fall by the 2sword
Their little ones will they dash in pieces
And their pregnant women they will rip open

Israels Future Blessing

AReturn O Israel to the LORD your God

For you have stumbled because of your iniquity
Take words with you and return to the LORD

Say to Him Take away all iniquity

And receive us graciously

That we may present the fruit of our lips
Assyria will not save us

We will not ride on horses

Nor will we say again Our god

To the work of our hands

For in You the orphan finds mercy
41 will heal their apostasy

I will love them freely

For My anger has turned away from them
I will resemble the dew to Israel

He will blossom like the lily

And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon
His shoots will sprout

And his beauty will resemble the olive tree

And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon
Those who live in his shadow

Will again raise grain

And they will blossom like the vine

His renown will resemble the wine of Lebanon
80 Ephraim what more have I to do with idols

I answer and look after you

I resemble a luxuriant cypress
From Me comes your fruit
whoever considers himself wise let him understand these things
Whoever discerns let him know them
For the ways of the LORD prove right
And the righteous will walk in them
But transgressors will stumble in them

Or in your fathers days
3T ell your sons about it
And let your sons tell their sons
And their sons the next generation

SAwake drunkards and weep
And wail all you wine drinkers
On account of the sweet wine
That your mouth no longer has
For a nation has invaded my land
Mighty and without number
Its teeth resemble the teeth of a lion
And it has the fangs of a lioness
7It has made my vine a waste
And my fig tree splinters
It has stripped them bare and cast them away
Their branches have become white
SQ wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth
For the bridegroom of her youth
The grain offering and the drink offering disappear
From the house of the LORD
The priests mourn
The ministers of the LORD
The field has gone to ruin
The land mourns
For the grain has become ruined
The new wine dries up
Fresh oil fails
110 Have shamed O farmers
Wail O vinedressers
For the wheat and the barley
Because the harvest of the field has suffered destruction
12The vine dries up
And the fig tree fails
The pomegranate the palm also and the apple tree
All the trees of the field dry up
Indeed rejoicing dries up
From the sons of men
1345Gird yourselves with sackcloth
And lament O priests
4Qwail O ministers of the altar
Come spend the night in sackcloth
O ministers of my God
For the grain offering and the drink offering
Are withheld from the house of your God

Starvation and Drought

142Consecrate a fast

Proclaim a solemn assembly

Gather the elders

And all the inhabitants of the land

To the house of the LORD your God

And cry out to the LORD
SAW Alas for the day

For the day of the LORD draws near

And it will come as destruction from the Almighty
6Has not food disappeared before our eyes

Gladness and joy from the house of our God
7The 4seeds shrivel under their clods
The storehouses suffered desolation
They have torn the barns down

The herds of cattle wander aimlessly
Because they have no pasture for them

For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness

Surely it draws near

2A day of darkness and gloom
A day of clouds and thick darkness
As the dawn spreads over the mountains
So there exists a great and mighty people
There has never existed anything like it
Nor will there ever again come after it
To the years of many generations
3a fire consumes before them
And behind them a flame burns
The land resembles the garden of Eden before them
But a desolate wilderness behind them
And nothing at all escapes them
Their appearance resembles the appearance of horses
And like war horses so they run
With a noise as of chariots
They leap on the tops of the mountains
Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble
Like a mighty people arranged for battle
SBefore them the people suffer anguish
All faces turn pale
They run like mighty men
They climb the wall like soldiers
And they each march in line
Nor do they deviate from their paths
8They do not crowd each other
They march everyone in his path
When they burst through the defenses
They do not break ranks
They rush on the city
They run on the wall
They climb into the houses
They enter through the windows like a thief
0Refore them the earth 2 quakes
The heavens tremble
The sun and the moon grow dark
And the stars lose their brightness
IThe LORD utters His voice before His army
Surely His camp looks very great
For he who carries out His word must have strength
The day of the LORD appears indeed great and very awesome
And who can endure it
12Vet even now declares the LORD
COReturn to Me with all your heart
And with fasting weeping and mourning
and rend your heart and not your garments 
Now return to the LORD your God
For He shows graciousness and compassion
Slow to anger abounding in lovingkindness
And relenting of evil
4who knows whether He will not turn and relent
And leave a blessing behind Him
Even a grain offering and a drink offering
For the LORD your God
154SBlow a trumpet in Zion
44 Consecrate a fast proclaim a solemn assembly
6Gather the people sanctify the congregation
Assemble the elders
Gather the children and the nursing infants
Let the bridegroom come out of his room
And the bride out of her bridal chamber
17_et the priests the LORDS ministers
Weep 4between the porch and the altar
And let them say 4Spare Your people O LORD
And do not make Your inheritance a reproach
A byword among the nations
Why should they among the peoples say
A Where has their God gone

Deliverance Promised

8Then the LORD will show zeal for His land
And will have pity on His people
The LORD will answer and say to His people
Behold I go to send you grain new wine and oil
And you will show satisfaction in full with them
And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations
But I will remove the northern army far from you
And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land
And its vanguard into the Yeastern sea
And its rear guard into the western sea
And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up
For it has done great things
212MD09 not fear O land rejoice and show gladness
For the LORD has done great things
22D0 not fear beasts of the field
For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green
For the tree has borne its fruit
The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full
23So rejoice O sons of Zion
And _ show gladness in the LORD your God
For He has given you the early rain for your vindication
And He has poured down for you the rain
The early and latter rain as before
4The threshing floors will fill with grain
And the vats will 2overflow with the new wine and oil
Then I will make up to you for the years
That the swarming locust has eaten
The creeping locust the stripping locust and the gnawing locust
My great army which I sent among you
26Vvou will have plenty to eat and satisfy yourself
And praise the name of the LORD your God
Who has dealt wondrously with you
Then My people will 2never fall into shame
27Thus you will know that I dwell in the midst of Israel
And that you will regard me as the LORD your God
And there exist no other
And My people will never fall into shame

The Promise of the Spirit

28n8Tt will come about after this
That I will pour out My Spirit on all 2mankind
And your sons and daughters will prophesy
Your old men will dream dreams
Your young men will see visions
22Even on the male and female servants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days

The Day of the LORD

30T will 2display wonders in the sky and on the earth
Blood fire and columns of smoke
31The 2sun will become dark
And the moon into blood
Before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes
32And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD
Will have deliverance
For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
There some will escape
As the LORD has said
Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls

The Nations Will receive judgment Judged

Eor behold in those days and at that time
When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem
71 will gather all the nations
And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat
Then I will enter into judgment with them there
On behalf of My people and My inheritance Israel
Whom they have scattered among the nations
And they have divided up My land
3They have also cast lots for My people
Traded a boy for a harlot
And sold a girl for wine that they may drink

Moreover what do I consider you  O tyre Sidon and all the regions of
Philistia Do you render Me a recompense But if you do recompense Me
swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head

Since you have taken My silver and My gold brought My precious
treasures to your temples

Sand sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to
remove them far from their territory

behold I plan to arouse them from the place where you have sold them
and return your recompense on your head

SAlso I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of
Judah and they will sell them to the Sabeans to a distant nation for the
LORD has spoken
Proclaim this among the nations
Prepare a war rouse the mighty men
Let all the soldiers draw near let them come up
10 Beat your plowshares into swords
And your pruning hooks into spears
Let the weak say I feel like a mighty man
1 Hasten and come all you surrounding nations
And gather yourselves there
Bring down O LORD Your mighty ones
121 et the nations wake up
 And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat

For there I will sit to judge

All the surrounding nations
1344Put in the sickle for the harvest has ripened

Come tread for the wine press has filledl

The vats overflow for their wickedness has waxed great
M44FMultitudes multitudes in the valley of decision

For the day of the LORD draws near in the valley of decision
SThe sun and moon grow dark

And the stars lose their brightness
6The LORD roars from Zion

And utters His voice from Jerusalem

And the heavens and the earth tremble

But the LORD has served as a refuge for His people

And a stronghold to the sons of Israel

7Then you will know that you must acknowledge me as the LORD your
God
Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain
So Jerusalem will become holy
And strangers will pass through it no more

Judah Will receive Blessings

18and in that day
The mountains will drip with sweet wine
And the hills will flow with milk
And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water
And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD
To water the valley of Shittim

2Egypt will become a waste
And Edom will become a desolate wilderness
Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah
In whose land they have shed innocent blood

But Judah will see habitation forever
And Jerusalem for all generations

21and I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged
For the LORD dwells in Zion
 Amos 1 9

Judgment on Neighbor Nations

The words of Amos who lived among the sheepherders from Tekoa
which he envisioned in visions concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king
of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel two
years before the earthquake

He said
The LORD roars from Zion
And from Jerusalem He utters His voice
And the shepherds pasture grounds mourn
And the summit of Carmel dries up
3Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Damascus and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they threshed Gilead with implements of sharp iron
So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael
And it will consume the citadels of Benhadad
T will also break the gate bar of Damascus
And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven
And him who holds the scepter from Betheden
So the people of Aram will go exiled to Kir
Says the LORD
Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Gaza and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they deported an entire population
To deliver it up to Edom
7So I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza
And it will consume her citadels
8T will also cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod
And him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon
I will even unleash My power upon Ekron
And the remnant of the Philistines will perish
Says the Lord GOD
 Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Tyre and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they delivered up an entire population to Edom
And did not remember the covenant of brotherhood
10So T will send fire upon the wall of Tyre
And it will consume her citadels
Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Edom and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because he pursued his brother with the sword
While he stifled his compassion
His anger also tore continually
And he maintained his fury forever
12So I will send fire upon Teman
And it will consume the citadels of Bozrah
3Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead
In order to enlarge their borders
14So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah
And it will consume her citadels
Amid war cries on the day of battle
And a storm on the day of tempest
SeTheir king will go into exile
He and his princes together says the LORD

Amos 2

NASB EPrime DFM

Judgment on Judah and Israel

Thus says the LORD

For three transgressions of Moab and for four

I will not revoke its punishment

Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime
 2So I will send fire upon Moab
And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth
And Moab will die amid tumult
With war cries and the sound of a trumpet
3T will also cut off the judge from her midst
And slay all her princes with him says the LORD
Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Judah and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they rejected the law of the LORD
And have not kept His statutes
Their lies also have led them astray
Those after which their fathers walked
5So I will send fire upon Judah
And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem
Thus says the LORD
For three transgressions of Israel and for four
I will not revoke its punishment
Because they sell the righteous for money
And the needy for a pair of sandals
These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the
helpless
Also turn aside the way of the humble
And a man and his father resort to the same girl
In order to profane My holy name
8On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar
And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have
received fines
Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them
Though his height compared to the height of cedars
And he proved strong as the oaks
I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below
10Tt was I who  brought you up from the land of Egypt
And I led you in the wilderness forty years
That you might take possession of the land of the Amorite
InThen I raised up some of your sons to become prophets
And some of your young men to become Nazirites
Is this not so O sons of Israel declares the LORD
 2But you made the Nazirites drink wine

And you commanded the prophets saying You 4shall not prophesy
3Behold I feel 42 weighted down beneath you

As a wagon becomes weighted down when filled with sheaves
14n4F light will perish from the swift

And the stalwart will not strengthen his power

Nor the mighty man save his life
Sue who grasps the bow will not stand his ground

The swift of foot will not escape

Nor will he who rides the horse save his life
16F Ven the bravest among the warriors will flee naked in that day

All the Tribes Have Guilt

Hear this word which the LORD has spoken against you sons of Israel
against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt
2Evou only have I chosen among all the families of the earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
3Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment
Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey
Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured
something
Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when no bait appears in it
Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all
SIf someone blows a trumpet in a city will not the people tremble
If a calamity occurs in a city has not the LORD done it

Surely the Lord GOD does nothing
Unless He reveals His secret counsel
To His servants the prophets
8a lion has roared Who will not fear
The Lord GOD has spoken Who can but prophesy
 Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of
Egypt and say Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and
see the great tumults within her and the oppressions in her midst

OuBut they do not know how to do right declares the LORD these who
hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels

Therefore thus says the Lord GOD
An enemy even one surrounding the land
Will pull down your strength from you
And an enemy will loot your citadels 

2Thus says the LORD

Just as the shepherd snatches from the lions mouth a couple of
legs or a piece of an ear

So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria become snatched away

With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch
3Hear and testify against the house of Jacob
Declares the Lord GOD the God of hosts
4Eor on the day that I punish Israels transgressions
I will also punish the altars of Bethel
They will cut off the horns of the altar
And they will fall to the ground

house
The houses of ivory will also perish
And the great houses will come to an end

Yet You Have Not Returned to Me

Who oppress the poor who crush the needy
Who say to your husbands Bring now that we may drink
 The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness
Behold the days come upon you
When they will take you away with meat hooks
And the last of you with fish hooks
3You will go out through breaches in the walls
Each one straight before her
And you will become cast to Harmon declares the LORD
Enter Bethel and transgress
In Gilgal multiply transgression
Bring your sacrifices every morning
Your tithes every three days
Offer a thank offering also from that which has become leavened
And proclaim Freewill offerings make them known
For so you love to do you sons of Israel
Declares the Lord GOD
SBut I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities
And lack of bread in all your places
Yet you have not returned to Me declares the LORD
7Eurthermore I withheld the rain from you
While there remained still three months until harvest
Then I would send rain on one city
And on another city I would not send rain
One part would not receive rain
While the part not rained on would dry up
8So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water
But would not become satisfied
Yet you have not returned to Me declares the LORD
T Wesmote you with scorching wind and mildew
And the caterpillar devoured
Your many gardens and vineyards fig trees and olive trees
Yet you have not returned to Me declares the LORD
10T sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt
I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured

horses

And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils
Yet you have not returned to Me declares the LORD

11T overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah
And you resembled a firebrand snatched from a blaze
 Yet you have not returned to Me declares the LORD
12Therefore thus I will do to you O Israel

Because I will do this to you

Prepare to meet your God O Israel

And declares to man what He had in His thoughts
He who makes dawn into darkness

Seek Me that You May Live

Hear this word which I take up for you as a dirge O house of Israel
She has fallen she will not rise again

The virgin Israel
She lies neglected on her land
No one will raise her up

3For thus says the Lord GOD
The city which goes forth a thousand strong
Will have a hundred left
And the one which goes forth a hundred strong
Will have ten left to the house of Israel

For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel
DSeek Me that you may live
But do not resort to Bethel
And do not come to Gilgal
Nor cross over to Beersheba
For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity
And Bethel will come to trouble
SSeek the LORD that you may live
Or He will break forth like a fire O house of Joseph
And it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel
7For those who turn justice into wormwood
And cast righteousness down to the earth
 8He who made the Pleiades and Orion
And changes deep darkness into morning
Who also darkens day into night
Who calls for the waters of the sea
And pours them out on the surface of the earth
The LORD we acknowledge as His name
 He flashes forth with destruction upon the strong
So that destruction comes upon the fortress
1They hate him who reproves in the gate
And they abhor him who speaks with integrity
Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor
And exact a tribute of grain from them
Though you have built houses of wellhewn stone
Yet you will not live in them
You have planted pleasant vineyards yet you will not drink their
wine
2Eor I know your transgressions have multiplied and your sins have
become great
You who distress the righteous and accept bribes
And turn aside the poor in the gate
13Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps silent for it
proves an evil time
4Seek good and not evil that you may live
And thus may the LORD God of hosts remain with you
45Just as you have said
S4QHate evil love good
And establish justice in the gate
Perhaps the LORD God of hosts
2mMay show graciousness to the remnant of Joseph

Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts the Lord
There will occur wailing in all the plazas
And in all the streets they say Alas Alas
They also call the farmer to mourning
And professional mourners to lamentation
17 And in all the 2vineyards they will hear wailing
Because I will pass through the midst of you says the LORD
8alas you who long for the day of the LORD
For what purpose will the day of the LORD have for you
It will turn into darkness and not light
19as when a man flees from a lion
And a bear meets him
Or goes home leans his hand against the wall
And a snake bites him
 20will not the day of the LORD turn into darkness instead of light
Even gloom with no brightness in it
2IT hate I 4M reject your festivals
Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies
22EVen though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain
offerings
I will not accept them
And I will not even look at the 2 peace offerings of your fatlings
23Take away from Me the noise of your songs
I will not even listen to the sound of your harps
4But let 2 justice roll down like waters
And righteousness like an everflowing stream

25A5Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the
wilderness for forty years O house of Israel

And go from there to Hamath the great
Then go down to Gath of the Philistines
Do we consider ourselves better than these kingdoms
Or do they have greater territory greater than yours
3Do you put off the day of calamity
And would you bring near the seat of violence

And sprawl on their Ycouches
 And eat lambs from the flock
And calves from the midst of the stall
Who improvise to the sound of the harp
And like David have composed songs for themselves
Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls
While they anoint themselves with the finest of oils
Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph
Therefore they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles
And the sprawlers banqueting will pass away
SThe Lord GOD has sworn by Himself the LORD God of hosts has

I loathe the arrogance of Jacob
And detest his citadels
Therefore I will deliver up the city and all it contains

bones from the house and he will say to the one who lives in the innermost
part of the house Does anyone else dwell with you And that one will
say No one  Then he will answer Keep quiet For the name of the LORD

 ord GOD please pardon
How can Jacob stand

Then I said
Lord GOD please stop
How can Jacob stand for he seems small
The LORD changed His mind about this
This too shall not occur said the Lord GOD

Thus He showed me and behold the Lord stood by a vertical wall with a
plumb line in His hand

The LORD said to me What do you see Amos And I said A plumb
line  Then the Lord said
Behold I will soon put a plumb line
In the midst of My people Israel
I will spare them no longer
The high places of Isaac will I will make desolate
And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste
Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword

Amos Accused Answers

Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to 2Jeroboam king of
Israel saying Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house
of Israel the land cannot endure all his words
 InEor thus Amos says Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will
certainly go from its land into exile

12Then Amaziah said to Amos Go you seer flee away to the land of
Judah and there eat bread and there do your prophesying

3But no longer prophesy at Bethel for it has become a sanctuary of
the king and a royal residence

44Then Amos replied to Amaziah I do not consider myself a prophet nor
the son of a prophet for I work as a herdsman and a grower of sycamore
figs

SBut the LORD took me from following the flock and the LORD said to me
Go prophesy to My people Israel

And the sabbath that we may open the wheat market
To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger
And to cheat with dishonest scales
So as to buy the helpless for money
And the needy for a pair of sandals
And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat

Indeed I will never forget any of their deeds
Because of this will not the land quake
And everyone who dwells in it mourn
Indeed all of it will rise up like the Nile
And it will toss about
And subside like the Nile of Egypt

That I will make the sun go down at noon
And make the earth dark in broad daylight
Then I will turn your festivals into mourning
And all your songs into lamentation
And I will bring sackcloth on everyones loins
And baldness on every head
And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son
And the end of it will seem like a bitter day
IBehold days come declares the Lord GOD
When I will send a famine on the land
Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water
But rather for hearing the words of the LORD
2Deople will stagger from sea to sea
And from the north even to the east
They will go to and fro to seek the word of the LORD
But they will not find it
13Th that day the beautiful virgins
And the young men will faint from thirst

Who say As your god lives O Dan
And As the way of Beersheba lives

And cast lots for Jerusalem
You too joined yourself to them

The day of his misfortune
And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah
In the day of their destruction
Yes do not boast
In the day of their distress

To cut down their fugitives
And do not imprison their survivors
In the day of their distress

The Day of the LORD and the Future

1SFor the day of the LORD draws near on all the nations
49as you have done you will receive
Your dealings will return on your own head
6Recause just as you drank on My holy mountain
All the nations will drink continually
They will drink and swallow
And become as if they had never existed
7But on Mount Zion there will stand those who escape
And it will become holy
And the house of Jacob wil possess their possessions
18Then the house of Jacob will resemble a fire
And the house of Joseph a flame
But the house of Esau will become as stubble
And they will set them on fire and consume them
So that no survivor of the house of Esau will exist

 AM
 For the LORD has spoken
Then those of the 2Negev will possess the mountain of Esau
And those of the Shephelah the Philistine plain
Also  possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria
And Benjamin will possess Gilead
and the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel
Who dwell among the Canaanites as far as 2 Zarephath
And the exiles of Jerusalem who live in Sepharad
Will possess the cities of the Negev
IThe 4Ydeliverers will ascend Mount Zion
To judge the mountain of Esau
And the kingdom will become the LORDS

Jonah 14

Rendered into EPrime by Dr David F Maas

Jonahs Disobedience
The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying

Arise go to Nineveh the great city and cry against it for their
wickedness has come up before Me

3But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD So
he went down to Joppa found a ship which planned to embark to
Tarshish paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish
from the presence of the LORD

The LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and a great storm developed
on the sea so that the ship almost broke up

Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried to his god and they
threw the cargo which the ship contained into the sea to lighten it for
 them But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship lain down and
fallen sound asleep

So the captain approached him and said How can you sleep Get up
Seall on your god Perhaps your god will concern himself with us so that
we will not perish

7Each man said to his mate Come let us cast lots so we may learn on
whose account this calamity has struck us  So they cast lots and the lot
fell on Jonah

8Then they said to him Tel us now On whose account has this calamity
struck us What do you do And where do you come from What country do
you come from From what people do you come from

He said to them I come from 2Hebrew stock and I fear the LORD
God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land

10Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him How
could you do this For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the
LORD because he had told them

1S0 they said to him What should we do to you that the sea may become
calm for usfor the sea had become increasingly stormy

12He said to them Pick me up and throw me into the sea Then the sea will
become calm for you for I know that on account of me this great storm
has come upon you

3However the men rowed desperately to return to land but they could not
for the sea became even stormier against them

4Then they called on the LORD and said We earnestly pray O LORD do
not let us perish on account of this mans life and do not put innocent blood
on us for You O LORD have done as You have pleased

15S0 they picked up Jonah threw him into the sea and the sea stopped
its raging

6Then the men feared the LORD greatly and they offered a sacrifice to the
LORD and made vows

7And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah and Jonah dwelled
in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights
 Jonah 2

NASB EPrime DFM
Jonahs Prayer

Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish

and he said
I ealled out of my distress to the LORD
And He answered me
I cried for help from the depth of Sheol
You heard my voice
3For You had cast me into the deep
Into the heart of the seas
And the current engulfed me
All Your breakers and billows passed over me
So I said  You have expelled me from Your sight
Nevertheless I will look again Stoward Your holy temple
 Water encompassed me to the point of death
The great deep engulfed me
Weeds wrapped around my head
5 Odescended to the roots of the mountains
The earth with its bars surrounded me forever
But You have brought up my life from the pit O LORD my God
While I fainted away
I remembered the LORD
And my prayer came to You
Into Your holy temple
8Those who regard vain idols
Forsake their faithfulness
But I will sacrifice to You
With the voice of thanksgiving
That which I have vowed I will pay
salvation comes from the LORD

1Then the LORD commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah up onto the
dry land

Nineveh Repents
Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time saying

Arise go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the proclamation
which I will tell you

3So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD
Now Nineveh we consider as an exceedingly great city a three days
walk

Then Jonah began to go through the city one days walk and he cried
out and said Yet forty days and Nineveh will become overthrown

Then the people of Nineveh believed in God and they called a fast and
put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them

When the word reached the king of Nineveh he arose from his throne laid
aside his robe from him covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the
ashes

7He issued a proclamation and it said In Nineveh by the decree of the
king and his nobles Do not let man beast herd or flock taste a thing Do
not let them eat or drink water

8But both man and beast must cover themselves with sackcloth and let
men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and
from the violence which remains in his hands

Dwho knows God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger
so that we will not perish

0When God saw their deeds that they turned from their wicked way
then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He
would bring upon them And He did not do it
 Jonah 4

NASB EPrime DFM

Jonahs Displeasure Rebuked
But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry

He prayed to the LORD and said Please LORD was not this what I said
while I still lived in my own country Therefore in order to forestall this I
fled to Tarshish for I knew You as a gracious and compassionate God
slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and one who relents
concerning calamity

3Therefore now O LORD please take my life from me for I would rather
die than live

The LORD said Do you have good reason to show anger

Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it There he made a
shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what
would happen in the city

So the LORD God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to serve as
a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort And Jonah felt
extremely happy about the plant

7But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day and it attacked
the plant and it withered

8When the sun came up God appointed a scorching east wind and the
sun beat down on Jonahs head so that he became faint and begged with
all his soul to die saying I would rather die rather than live

Then God said to Jonah Do you have good reason to rage about the
plant And he said I have good reason to have anger even to death

Then the LORD said You had compassion on the plant for which you did
not work and which you did not cause to grow which came up overnight and
perished overnight

Should I not have compassion on Nineveh the great city in which dwell
more than 120000 persons who do not know the difference between their
right and left hand as well as many animals

Destruction in Israel and Judah

The word of the LORD which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days
of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah which he saw
concerning Samaria and Jerusalem

Hear O peoples all of you
Listen O earth and all it contains
And let the Lord GOD witness against you
The Lord from His holy temple
3For behold the LORD comes forth from His place
He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth
4QThe mountains will melt under Him
And the valleys will split
Like wax before the fire
Like water poured down a steep place
All this occurred because of the rebellion of Jacob
And for the sins of the house of Israel
What do we mean the rebellion of Jacob
Does it not constitute Samaria
What do we consider the high place of Judah
Do we not consider it Jerusalem
For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country
Planting places for a vineyard
I will pour her stones down into the valley
And will lay bare her foundations
7Al of her idols I will smash
All of her earnings will I burn with fire
And all of her images I will make desolate
For she collected them from a harlots earnings
And to the earnings of a harlot they will return
 8Because of this I must lament and wail
I must go barefoot and naked
I must make a lament like the jackals
And a mourning like the ostriches
For her wound has become incurable
For it has come to Judah
It has reached the gate of my people
Even to Jerusalem
10 ell it not in Gath
Weep not at all
At Bethleaphrah roll yourself in the dust
11Go0 on your way inhabitant of Shaphir in shameful nakedness
The inhabitant of 4Zaanan does not escape
The lamentation of Bethezel He will take from you its support
12For the inhabitant of Maroth
Becomes weak waiting for good
Because a calamity has come down from the LORD
To the gate of Jerusalem
3Harness the chariot to the team of horses
O inhabitant of Lachish
She became the beginning of sin
To the daughter of Zion
Because in you we found
The rebellious acts of Israel
4Therefore you will give parting 4
On behalf of Moreshethgath
The houses of  Achzib will become a deception
To the kings of Israel
SMoreover I will bring on you
The one who takes possession
O inhabitant of 42Mareshah
The glory of Israel will enter 2Adullam
6make yourself  bald and cut off your hair
Because of the children of your delight
Extend your baldness like the eagle
For they will go from you into exile

NASB EPrime DFM

Woe to Oppressors

Woe to those who scheme iniquity

Who work out evil on their beds

When morning comes they do it

For they have the power of their hands
They covet fields and then seize them

And houses and take them away

They rob a man and his house

A man and his inheritance

3Therefore thus says the LORD
Behold I plan against this family a calamity
From which you cannot remove your necks
And you will not walk haughtily
For it will prove an evil time
On that day they will take up against you a taunt
And utter a bitter lamentation and say
We find ourselves completely destroyed
He exchanges the portion of my people
How He removes it from me
To the apostate He apportions our fields
Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line
For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD
2D9 not speak out so they speak out
But if they do not speak out concerning these things
Reproaches I will not turn back
7People say O house of Jacob
Has the Spirit of the LORD proved impatient
Does this look like His doings
Do not My words do good
To the one walking uprightly
SRecently My people have arisen as an enemy
You strip the robe off the garment
 From unsuspecting passersby
From those returned from war
The women of My people you evict
Each one from her pleasant house
From her children you take My 44splendor forever
1OArise and go
For this has become no place of rest
Because of the 9uncleanness that brings on destruction
A painful destruction
ITf a man walking after wind and falsehood
Had told lies and said
T will speak out to you concerning 2wine and liquor
He would serve as a spokesman to this people
12nT will surely assemble all of you Jacob
I will surely gather the remnant of Israel
I will put them together like sheep in the fold
Like a flock in the midst of its pasture
They will resound with the noise of men
3The breaker goes up before them
They break out pass through the gate and go out by it
So their king goes on before them
And the LORD at their head

Rulers Denounced

And I said
 Hear now heads of Jacob
And rulers of the house of Israel
Do you not consider it time for you to know justice
2You who hate good and love evil
Who tear off their skin from them
And their flesh from their bones
3Who eat the flesh of my people
Strip off their skin from them
Break their bones
And chop them up as for the pot
 And as meat in a kettle
Then they will cry out to the LORD
But He will not answer them
Instead He will hide His face from them at that time
Because they have practiced evil deeds

Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray
When they have something to bite with their teeth
They cry Peace

But against him who puts nothing in their mouths
They declare holy war
Therefore it will appear as night for youwithout vision
And darkness for youwithout divination
The sun will go down on the prophets
And the day will become dark over them
The seers will feel Yashamed
And the diviners will embarrass themselves
Indeed they will all cover their mouths
Because God does not answer 
8On the other hand I have become filled with power
With the Spirit of the LORD
And with justice and courage
To make known to Jacob his rebellious act
Even to Israel his sin
Now hear this heads of the house of Jacob
And rulers of the house of Israel
Who abhor justice
And twist everything that appeared straight
who build Zion with bloodshed
And Jerusalem with violent injustice
1Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe
Her priests instruct for a price
And her prophets divine for money
Yet they lean on the LORD saying
Do we not find the LORD in our midst
Calamity will not come upon us
Therefore on account of you
Zion will become plowed as a field
Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins
And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest

Peaceful Latter Days

And it will come about in the last days
That the mountain of the house of the LORD
Will become established as the chief of the mountains
It will rise above the hills
And the peoples will stream to it
22Many nations will come and say
Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD
And to the house of the God of Jacob
That He may teach us about His ways
And that we may walk in His paths 
For from Zion will go forth the law
Even the word of the LORD from Jerusalem
3And He will judge between many peoples
And render decisions for mighty distant nations
Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares
And their spears into pruning hooks
Nation will not lift up sword against nation
And never again will they train for war
Each of them will sit under his vine
And under his fig tree
With no one to make them afraid
For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken
Though all the peoples walk
Each in the name of his god
As for us we will walk
In the name of the LORD our God forever and ever
In that day declares the LORD
I will assemble the lame
And gather the outcasts
Even those whom I have afflicted
7T will make the lame a remnant
And the outcasts a strong nation
And the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion
 From now on and forever
8As for you tower of the flock
Hill of the daughter of Zion
To you it will come

Do you have no king among you
Or has your counselor perished

Daughter of Zion
Like a woman in childbirth
For now you will go out of the city
Dwell in the field
And go to Babylon
There the Lord will rescue you
There the LORD will redeem you
From the hand of your enemies
4and now many nations assembled themselves against you
Who say Let her become polluted
And let our eyes gloat over Zion
2But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD
And they do not understand His purpose
For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor
3arise and thresh daughter of Zion
For your horn I will make iron
And your hoofs I will make bronze

That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain
And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth

Then the remainder of His brethren

In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God

Because the LORD has a case against His people
Even with Israel He will dispute

3OmMy people what have I done to you

And how have I wearied you Answer Me

Indeed I brought you up from the land of Egypt
And ransomed you from the house of slavery
And I sent before you Moses Aaron and Miriam

My people remember now
What Balak king of Moab counseled
And what Balaam son of Beor answered him

And from Shittim to Gilgal
So that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD

What God Requires of Man

swith what shall I come to the LORD
And bow myself before the God on high
Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings
With yearling calves
Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams
In ten thousand rivers of oil
Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts
The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
8He has told you O man what proves good
And what does the LORD require of you
But to do justice to love kindness
And to walk humbly with your God
The voice of the LORD will call to the city
And we consider it sound wisdom to fear Your name
 Hear O tribe Who has appointed its time
10 Does another man live in the wicked house
Along with treasures of wickedness
And a short measure that has become cursed
Can I justify wicked scales
And a bag of deceptive weights
12Eor the rich men of the city prove themselves full of violence
Her residents speak lies
And their tongue shows deceit in their mouth
13So also I will make you sick striking you down
4Desolating you because of your sins

And your vileness will dwell in your midst
You will try to remove for safekeeping
But you will not preserve anything
And what you do preserve I will give to the sword
Svou will sow but you will 42not reap
You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil
And the grapes but you will not drink wine

The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries

3The LORD has slowness to anger and greatness in power
And the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished

He rebukes the sea and makes it dry
He dries up all the rivers
Bashan and Carmel wither
The blossoms of Lebanon wither

Mountains quake because of Him
And the hills dissolve
Indeed the earth appears upheaved by His presence
The world and all the inhabitants in it

Swho can stand before His indignation
Who can endure the burning of His anger
He pours His 2wrath out like fire
And He breaks up the rocks 

7The LORD does good

And He knows those who take refuge in Him

Your name will no longer continue
I will cut off idol and image
From the house of your gods
I will prepare your grave

Who announces peace
Celebrate your feasts O Judah
Pay your vows
For never again will the wicked one pass through you

And destroyed their vine branches

The warriors dress in scarlet
The chariots have become enveloped in flashing steel

And they brandish cypress spears
 The chariots race madly in the streets
They rush wildly in the squares
Their appearance resemble torches
They dash to and fro like lightning flashes
He remembers his nobles
They stumble in their march
They hurry to her wall
And they set the mantelet up
The gates of the rivers open
And the palace dissolves
7It has become fixed
They strip her and carry away
And her handmaids moan like the sound of doves
Beating on their breasts
8Though Nineveh resembled a pool of water throughout her days
Now they flee
Stop stop
But no one turns back
Plunder the silver
Plunder the gold
For there seems no limit to the treasure
Wealth from every kind of desirable object
She has emptied Yes she has become desolate and waste
Hearts melt and knees knock
Also anguish fills the whole body
And all their faces grow pale

And the feeding place of the young lions
Where the lion lioness and lions cub prowled
With nothing to disturb them

Killed enough for his lionesses

And his dens with torn flesh

Settling in the stone walls on a cold day

The sun rises and they flee
And the place where they go they do not know

8Vour shepherds sleep O king of Assyria

Your nobles recline
Your people scatter on the mountains
And no one will regather them

Your wound seems incurable
 All who hear about you
will clap their hands over you
For on whom has not your evil passed continually

Chaldeans Used to Punish Judah

The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw

2 How long O LORD will I call for help

And You will not hear

I cry out to You Violence

Yet You do not save
3why do You make me see iniquity

And cause me to look on wickedness

Yes destruction and violence are before me

Strife exists and contention arises
Therefore the people ignore the law

And no one ever uphold justice

For the wicked surround the righteous

Therefore justice comes out perverted
L_ook among the nations Observe

Become astonished Wonder

Because I do something in your days

You would not believe if someone told you
Eor behold I will raise up the Chaldeans

That fierce and impetuous people

Who march throughout the earth

To seize dwelling places which do not belong to them
7People dread and fear them

Their justice and authority originate with themselves
STheir horses move swifter than leopards

And keener than wolves in the evening

Their horsemen come galloping
 Their horsemen come from afar
They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour
All of them come for violence
Their horde of faces moves forward
They collect captives like sand
They mock at kings
And rulers become a laughing matter to them
They laugh at every fortress
And heap up rubble to capture it
1 Then they will sweep through like the wind and pass on
But people will judge them guilty
They who regard strength as their god
2Do You not exist from everlasting
O LORD my God my Holy One
We will not die
You O LORD have appointed them to judge
And You O Rock have established them to correct
13ou have eyes too pure to approve evil
And You can not look on wickedness with favor
Why do You look with favor
On those who deal treacherously
Why do You remain silent when the wicked swallow up
Those more righteous than they
4why have You made men like the fish of the sea
Like creeping things without a ruler over them
SThe Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook
Drag them away with their net
And gather them together in their fishing net
Therefore they rejoice and become glad
Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net
And burn incense to their fishing net
Because through these things their catch appears large
And their food has become plentiful
17will they therefore empty their net
And continually slay nations without sparing

God Answers the Prophet

T will stand on my guard post
And station myself on the rampart
And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me
And how I may reply when He reproves me
Then the LORD answered me and said
Record the vision
And inscribe it on tablets
That the one who reads it may run
3For the vision I have reserved yet for the appointed time
It hastens toward the goal and it will not fail
Though it tarries wait for it
For it will certainly come it will not delay
Behold as for the proud one
His soul has no righteousness within him
But the righteous will live by his faith
Furthermore wine betrays the haughty man
So that he does not stay at home
He enlarges his appetite like Sheol
And he like death never has satisfaction
He also gathers to himself all nations
And collects to himself all peoples
Swill not all of these take up a tauntsong against him
Even mockery and insinuations against him
And say Dwoe to him who increases what does not belong to him
For how long
And makes himself rich with loans
 7Will not your creditors rise up suddenly
And those who collect from you awaken
Indeed you will become plunder for them
8Because you have looted many nations
All the remainder of the peoples will loot you
Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land
To the town and all its inhabitants
Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house
To put his nest on high
To receive deliverence delivered from the hand of calamity
vou have devised a shameful thing for your house
By cutting off many peoples
So you sin against yourself
Surely the stone will cry out from the wall
And the rafter will answer it from the framework
12Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
And founds a town with violence
3Does it not indeed come from the LORD of hosts
That peoples toil for fire
And nations grow weary for nothing
4Eor the earth will fill
With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD
As the waters cover the sea
SWoe to you who make your neighbors drink
Who mix in your venom even to make them drunk
So as to look on their nakedness
6vou will fill with disgrace rather than honor
Now you yourself drink and expose your own nakedness
The cup in the LORDS right hand will come around to you
And utter disgrace will come upon your glory
17Eor the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you
And the devastation of its beasts by which you terrified them
Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land
To the town and all its inhabitants
Swhat 2 profit does the idol bring when its maker has carved it
Or an image a teacher of falsehood
For its maker trusts in his own handiwork
When he fashions speechless idols
 12Woe to him who says to a piece of wood  Awake
To a mute stone Arise
And that you consider your teacher
Behold you overlaid the idol with gold and silver
And it has no breath at all inside it

2But the LORD dwells in His holy temple
Let all the earth keep silent before Him

Gods Deliverance of His People

A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet according to lalShigionoth
LORD I have heard the report about You and I fear
O LORD revive Your work in the midst of the years
In the midst of the years make it known
In wrath remember mercy
3God comes from Teman
And the Holy One from Mount Paran Selah
His splendor covers the heavens
And the earth fills full of His praise
His radiance resembles the sunlight
He has rays flashing from His hand
And there we witness the hiding of His power
Before Him goes pestilence
And plague comes after Him
He stood and surveyed the earth
He looked and startled the nations
Yes the perpetual mountains became shattered
The ancient hills collapsed
His ways exist forever
7I saw the tents of Cushan under distress
The tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled
 SDid the LORD rage against the rivers
Or did You demonstrate Your anger against the rivers
Or did You demonstrate Your wrath against the sea
That You rode on Your horses
On Your chariots of salvation
Your bow became bare
You swore the rods of chastisement Selah
You cleaved the earth with rivers
The mountains saw You and quaked
The downpour of waters swept by
The deep uttered forth its voice
It lifted high its hands
11Sun and moon stood in their places
They went away at the light of Your arrows
At the radiance of Your gleaming spear
2Th indignation You marched through the earth
In anger You trampled the nations
43ou went forth for the salvation of Your people
For the salvation of Your anointed
You struck the head of the house of the evil
To lay him open from thigh to neck Selah
14Vou pierced with his own spears
The head of his throngs
They stormed in to scatter us
Their exultation seemed like those
Who devour the oppressed in secret
Sou trampled on the sea with Your horses
On the surge of many waters
61 heard and my inward parts trembled
At the sound my lips quivered
Decay enters my bones
And in my place I tremble
Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress
For the  people to arise who will invade us
7Though the Fig tree should not blossom
And there will grow no fruit on the vines
Though the yield of the olive should fail
And the fields produce no food
 Though the flock should become cut off from the fold
And you find no cattle in the stalls
Bvet I will exult in the LORD
I will P rejoice in the YGod of my salvation
SThe Lord GOD serves as my strength
And He has made my feet like hinds feet
And makes me walk on my high places
For the choir director on my stringed instruments

Day of Judgment on Judah

The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of
Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah in the days of Josiah son of
Amon king of Judah
2T will completely remove all things
From the face of the earth declares the LORD
3T will remove man and beast
I will remove the birds of the sky
And the fish of the sea
And the ruins along with the wicked
And I will cut off man from the face of the earth declares the LORD
4So I will stretch out My hand against Judah
And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place
And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests
5And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven
And those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by
Milcom
SAnd those who have turned back from following the LORD
And those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him
7 Keep silent before the Lord GOD
For the day of the LORD draws near
 For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice
He has consecrated His guests
8Then it will come about on the day of the LORDS sacrifice
That I will punish the princes the kings sons
And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments
And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold
Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit
1On that day declares the LORD
The sound of a cry will come from the Fish Gate
A wail from the Second Quarter
And a loud crash from the hills
Imwail O inhabitants of the Mortar
For all the people of Canaan will fall into silence
All who weigh out silver will find themselves cut off
2Tt will come about at that time
That I will search Jerusalem with lamps
And I will punish the men
Who have become stagnant in spirit
Who say in their hearts
The LORD will not do good or evil
13Moreover their wealth will become plunder
And their houses desolate
Yes 4 they will build houses but not inhabit them
And plant vineyards but not drink their wine
4 The 2great day of the LORD draws near
Near and coming very quickly
Listen the day of the LORD
In it the warrior cries out bitterly
Sa day of wrath describes that day
A day of trouble and distress
A day of destruction and desolation
A day of darkness and gloom
A day of clouds and thick darkness
16a day of trumpet and battle cry
Against the fortified cities
And the high corner towers
7T will bring distress on men
So that they will walk like the blind
 Because they have sinned against the LORD
And their blood will pour out like dust
And their flesh like dung
8Neither their silver nor their gold
Will have the capability to deliver them
On the day of the LORDS wrath
And all the earth will become devoured
In the fire of His jealousy
For He will make a complete end
Indeed a terrifying one
Of all the inhabitants of the earth

With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks
7And the Lord will turn the coast over to the remnant of the house of

Judah

They will pasture on it

In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening

And the revilings of the sons of Ammon

With which they have taunted My people

And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah

And a perpetual desolation

And the remainder of My nation will inherit them

1This they will have in return for their pride because they have
taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts

11The LORD will prove a terror to them for He will starve all the gods of
the earth and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him
everyone from his own place
12 T will slay you also O Ethiopians by My sword
3and He will stretch out His hand against the north
And destroy Assyria
And He will make Nineveh a desolation
Parched like the wilderness
4Elocks will lie down in her midst
All beasts which range in herds
Both the pelican and the hedgehog
Will lodge in the tops of her pillars
Birds will sing in the window
Desolation will lie on the threshold

In the second year of Darius the king on the first day of the sixth
month the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to
27erubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the
son of Jehozadak the high priest saying

Thus says the LORD of hosts This people says The time has not come
even the time for someone to rebuild the house of the LORD

3Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying

 Do you feel you can dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies
desolate

Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts Consider your ways

SYou have sown much but harvest little you eat but you dont find
enough to feel satisfied you drink but you cannot even drink enough to
become drunk you put on clothing but no one is warm enough and he who
ears earns wages to put into a purse with holes

Thus says the LORD of hosts Consider your ways

8Go up to the mountains bring wood and rebuild the temple that I may
take pleasure with it and become glorified says the LORD

9Ovou look for much but behold it comes to little when you bring it
home I blow it away Why declares the LORD of hosts Because of My
house which lies desolate while each of you runs to his own house

1OuTherefore because of you the sky has withheld its dew and the earth
has withheld its produce

1T called for a drought on the land on the mountains on the grain on
the new wine on the oil on what the ground produces on men on cattle
and on all the labor of your hands

2Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of
Jehozadak the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the
voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet as the
 LORD their God had sent him And the people showed reverence for the
LORD

3Then Haggai the messenger of the LORD spoke by the commission of
the LORD to the people saying  Wy accompany you declares the LORD

to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and to the remnant of
the people saying

3Who remains among you who saw this temple in its former glory And
how do you see it now Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison

But now take courage Zerubbabel declares the LORD take courage
also Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and all you people of the land
take courage declares the LORD and work for I accompany you

As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt My
Spirit abides in your midst do not fear

SFor thus says the LORD of hosts Once more in a little while I will
2shake the heavens and the earth the sea also and the dry land

T will shake all the nations and they will come with the wealth of all
nations and I will fill this house with glory says the LORD of hosts

InThus says the LORD of hosts Ask now the priests for a ruling

211 a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches
bread with this fold or cooked food wine oil or any other food will it
become holy And the priests answered No

3Then Haggai said If one who has become unclean from a corpse
touches any of these will the latter become unclean And the priests
answered It will become unclean

4Then Haggai said  4So does this people And so has this nation before
Me declares the LORD and so has every work of their hands and what
they offer there has become unclean

But now do consider from this day onward before one stone
becomes placed on another in the temple of the LORD

Sfrom that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures there
would number only ten and when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty
measures there would number only twenty

71 smote you and every work of your hands with blasting wind mildew
and hail yet you did not come back to Me declares the LORD

the ninth month from the day when the temple of the LORD becomes
constructed consider

Do you still find the seed in the barn Even including the vine the fig
tree the pomegranate and the olive tree it has not borne fruit Yet from this
day on I will bless you

Dtwentyfourth day of the month saying
 21Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah saying I will shake the
heavens and the earth

2217 will 4 overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of

the kingdoms of the nations and I will overthrow the chariots and their

3Therefore say to them Thus says the LORD of hosts Return to Me

Patrol of the Earth

7On the twentyfourth day of the eleventh month which we acknowledge as
the month Shebat in the second year of Darius the word of the LORD came
to Zechariah the prophet the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo as follows

81 saw at night and behold a man rode on a red horse and he stood
among the myrtle trees which stood in the ravine with red sorrel and
white horses behind him

Then I said My lord what do you call these And the angel who
spoke with me said to me I will show you what these mean

Sand the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said
These we identify as those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth

1S0 they answered the angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle
trees and said We have patrolled the earth and behold all the earth has
become peaceful and quiet

Then the angel of the LORD said O LORD of hosts how long will You
have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which You
have remained indignant these seventy years

3The LORD answered the angel who spoke with me with gracious words
comforting words

14S0 the angel who spoke with me said to me 4Proclaim saying Thus
says the LORD of hosts I have become 4exceedingly jealous for
Jerusalem and Zion

SBut Ihave much anger with the nations who have become at
ease for while I felt only a little angry they furthered the disaster

Therefore thus says the LORD I will return to Jerusalem with
compassion they will build My house in it declares the LORD of hosts
and I will stretch a measuring line over Jerusalem
 7 Again proclaim saying Thus says the LORD of hosts My cities will
again overflow with prosperity and the LORD will again comfort Zion and
again choose Jerusalem

18Then I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold I saw four horns

So0 I said to the angel who spoke with me What do you call these And
he answered me These symbolize the horns which have scattered
Judah Israel and Jerusalem

2Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen

211 said What do these who come propose to do And he said These
symbolize the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up
his head but these craftsmen have come to terrify them to throw down
the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of

iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes

T said What does this signify And he said This represents the Sephah
going forth Again he said This signifies their appearance in all the land

7and behold a lead cover appeared lifted up and a woman sits inside the
ephah

Then he said This represents Wickedness And he threw her down into
the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked and two women came out with the
wind in their wings and they had wings like the wings of a stork and they
lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens

101 said to the angel who spoke with me Where do they take the ephah

IThen he said to me To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar and
when we prepare it she will stand there on her own pedestal

The Four Chariots

Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked and behold four chariots
came forth from between the two mountains and the mountains appeared
as bronze mountains

With the first chariot came red horses with the second chariot black
horses

3with the third chariot white horses and with the fourth chariot strong
dappled horses

Then I spoke and said to the angel who spoke with me what do these
mean my lord

The angel replied to me These represent the four spirits of heaven
going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth

with one of which the black horses to go forth to the north country and
the white ones go forth after them while the dappled ones go forth to the
south country

7When the strong ones went out they seemed eager to go to patrol the
earth And He said Go patrol the earth So they patrolled the earth

8Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying See those who go to
the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north

The word of the LORD also came to me saying

10uTake an offering from the exiles from Heldai Tobijah and Jedaiah and
you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah
where they have arrived from Babylon

The Symbolic Crowns

IeTake silver and gold make an ornate crown and set it on the head of
2Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest
 2Then say to him Thus says the LORD of hosts Behold a man whose
name is Branch for He will branch out from where He stands and He
will build the temple of the LORD

13Veas He will build the temple of the LORD and He will bear the honor
and sit and rule on His throne Thus He will serve as a priest on His
throne and the counsel of peace will exist between the two offices

4Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to
Helem Tobijah Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah

15uWThose who live far off will come and build the temple of the LORD 
Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you And it will
take place if you completely obey the LORD your God

Hearts like Flint

In the fourth year of King Darius the word of the LORD came to Zechariah
on the fourth day of the ninth month which we acknowledge as Chislev

2Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their
men to seek the favor of the LORD

3speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts
and to the prophets saying Shall I weep in the Fifth month and abstain
as I have done these many years

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying

Say to all the people of the land and to the priests When you fasted and
mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years did you
actually fast for me

When you eat and drink do you not eat for yourselves and do you not
drink for yourselves
 7 Do you not recognize these words which the LORD proclaimed by the
former prophets when Jerusalem had inhabitants and prosperous along
with its cities around it and the Negev and the foothills also had
inhabitants

8Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying

Thus has the LORD of hosts said Dispense true justice and practice
kindness and compassion each to his brother

Cand do not oppress the widow or the orphan the stranger or the poor
and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another

ImBut they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder
and stopped their ears from hearing

12They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law
and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the
former prophets therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts

3and just as He called and they would not listen so they called and I
would not listen says the LORD of hosts

but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom
they have not Known Thus the land has become desolate behind them so

that no one went back and forth for they made the pleasant land
desolate

The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came saying

Thus says the LORD of hosts I have become exceedingly jealous for
Zion yes with great wrath I feel jealous for her
 3Thus says the LORD I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of
Jerusalem Then people will call Jerusalem the City of Truth and the
mountain of the LORD of hosts people will call the Holy Mountain

Thus says the LORD of hosts Old men and old women will again sit in
the streets of Jerusalem each man with his staff in his hand because of
age

And the streets of the city will be fill with boys and girls playing in its
streets

SThus says the LORD of hosts If it seems too difficult in the sight of the
remnant of this people in those days will it also seem too difficult in My
sight declares the LORD of hosts

Thus says the LORD of hosts Behold I intend to save My people from the
land of the east and from the land of the west

Sand I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem
and I shall call them my people and they will consider me their God in
truth and righteousness

Thus says the LORD of hosts Let your hands remain strong you who
listen in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets those
who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts
was laid to the end that the temple might become built

OF or before those days there came no wage for man or any wage for
animal and for him who went out or came in there existed no peace
because of his enemies and I set all men one against another

But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former
days declares the LORD of hosts

12For there will come peace for the seed the vine will yield its fruit the
land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew and I will
cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things

13Tt will come about that just as you became a curse among the nations
O house of Judah and house of Israel so I will save you that you may
become a blessing Do not fear let your hands remain strong
 4Eor thus says the LORD of hosts Just as I purposed to do harm to you
when your fathers provoked Me to wrath says the LORD of hosts and I
have not relented

Sso I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to
the house of Judah Do not fear

6These things you should do speak the truth to one another 4 judge
with truth and judgment for peace in your gates

7Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another and do
not love perjury for all these I 9 hate declares the LORD

8Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying

SThus says the LORD of hosts The fast of the fourth the fast of the
Fifth the fast of the 2seventh and the fast of the tenth months will
become joy gladness and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah so
love truth and peace

20Thus says the LORD of hosts It will yet occur that peoples will come
even the inhabitants of many cities

2The inhabitants of one will go to another saying Let us go at once to
4 entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts I will also
go

22159 2 many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of
hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD

Prophecies against Neighboring Nations

The burden of the word of the LORD comes against the land of Hadrach
with Damascus as its resting place for the eyes of men especially of all
the tribes of Israel look toward the LORD

2And Hamath also which borders on it
Tyre and Sidon though they seem very wise
3For Tyre built herself a fortress
And piled up silver like dust
And gold like the mire of the streets
Behold the Lord will dispossess her
And cast her wealth into the sea
And she will become consumed with fire
SAshkelon will see it and fear
Gaza too will writhe in great pain
Also Ekron for her expectation has become confounded
Moreover the king will perish from Gaza
And Ashkelon will not have inhabitants
SAnd a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod
And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines
7And I will remove their blood from their mouth
And their detestable things from between their teeth
Then they also will become a remnant for our God
And seem like a clan in Judah
And Ekron like a Jebusite
8But I will camp around My house because of an army
Because of him who passes by and returns
And no oppressor will pass over them anymore
For now I have seen with My eyes
 Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion
Shout in triumph O daughter of Jerusalem
Behold your king comes to you
He appears just and endowed with salvation
Humble and mounted on a donkey
Even on a colt the foal of a donkey
107 will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
And the horse from Jerusalem
And the bow of war I will cut off
And He will speak peace to the nations
 And His dominion will range from sea to sea
And from the River to the ends of the earth

Deliverance of Judah and Ephraim

Ins for you also because of the blood of My covenant with you
I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit
12Return to the stronghold O prisoners who have the hope
This very day I declare that I will restore double to you
3For I will  bend Judah as My bow
I will fill the bow with Ephraim
And I will stir up your sons O Zion against your sons O Greece
And I will make you like a warriors sword
44Then the LORD will appear over them
And His arrow will go forth like lightning
And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet
And will march in the storm winds of the south
154The LORD of hosts will defend them
And they will 4devour and trample on the sling stones
And they will drink and become boisterous as with wine
And they will become filled like a sacrificial basin
Drenched like the corners of the altar
and the LORD their God will save them in that day
As the flock of His people
For they resemble the stones of a 2 crown
Sparkling in His land

Grain will make the young men flourish and new wine the virgins

And tell false dreams

Therefore the people wander like sheep

The Doomed Flock

Open your doors O Lebanon

That a fire may feed on your cedars

Wail O cypress for the cedar has fallen
Because the glorious trees have suffered destruction
Wail O oaks of Bashan
For the impenetrable forest has come down

3There comes a sound of the shepherds wail
For their glory has turned into ruin
We hear the sound of the young lions roar
For the pride of the Jordan has turned into ruine

Thus says the LORD my God Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter
 Those who buy them slay them and go Unpunished and each of those
who sell them says Blessed we acknowledge the LORD for I have
become rich And their Yown shepherds have no pity on them

SEor I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land declares
the LORD but behold I will Qeause the men to fall each into anothers
power and into the power of his king and they will strike the land and I will
Snot deliver them from their power

7So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter hence the afflicted of the
flock And I took for myself two staffs the one I called Favor and the
other I called Union so I pastured the flock

8Then I annihilated the three shepherds in Mone month for my soul felt
impatience with them and their soul also felt weary of me

Then I said I will not pasture you What will die let it die and what will
become annihilated let it become annihilated and let those who remain eat
one anothers flesh

1T took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces to break my covenant which
I had made with all the peoples

11S0 it broke on that day and thus the afflicted of the flock who
watched me realized that the word of the LORD had come upon them

2T said to them If you consider it good in your sight give me my
wages but if not never mind So they weighed out thirty shekels of
silver as my wages

13Then the LORD said to me Throw it to the potter that magnificent
price at which they valued me So I took the thirty shekels of silver and
threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD

44Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union to break the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel

SThe LORD said to me Take again for yourself the equipment of a
4Foolish shepherd

16For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for
the perishing seek the scattered heal the broken or sustain the one
standing but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their
hoofs

His arm will totally wither

Jerusalem to undergo attack

The 2lburden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel Thus declares the
LORD who stretches out the heavens lays the foundation of the earth
and forms the spirit of man within him

2Behold I intend to make Jerusalem a eup that causes reeling to all the
peoples around and when the siege takes place against Jerusalem it will
also takes place against Judah

3Tt will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone
for all the peoples all who lift it will severely injure themselves And all
the nations of the earth will gather against it

In that day declares the LORD I will strike every horse with
bewilderment and his rider with madness But I will watch over the house of
Judah while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness

Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts A strong support for us
are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts their God

STh that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of
wood and a flaming torch among sheaves so they will consume on the right
hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples while the inhabitants of
Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem

The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first so that the glory of the
house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not
magnify above Judah
 8Th that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the
one who appears feeble among them in that day will resemble David and
the house of David will resemble God like the angel of the LORD before
them

And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come
against Jerusalem

0nT will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of
Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplication so that they will look on
Me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for Him as one
mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter
weeping over a firstborn

ITh that day there will arise great mourning in Jerusalem like the
mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo

2The land will mourn every family by itself the family of the house of
David by itself and their wives by themselves the family of the house of
Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves

 them any longer and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean

3And if anyone still prophesies then his father and mother who gave
birth to him will say to him You shall not live for you have spoken

God Will Battle Jerusalems Foes

Behold a day comes for the LORD when the spoil taken from you
others will divide among you

For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city
will suffer captivity the houses plundered the women ravished and half of
the city exiled but the rest of the people will not become cut off from the
city

3Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations as when He
fights on a day of battle

In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which stands in
front of Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of Olives will Denlit in its
middle from east to west by a very large valley so that half of the mountain
will move toward the north and the other half toward the south

You will flee by the valley of My mountains for the valley of the mountains
will reach to Azel yes you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah Then the LORD my God will come
and all the holy ones with Him

Tn that day no light will appear the luminaries will dwindle

For there will come a unique day which the LORD knows neither day
nor night but it will come about that at evening time light will appear

Sand in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem half of them
toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea it will
occur in summer as well as in winter

God Will Serve as King over All

And the LORD will rule as king over all the earth in that day we will
acknowledge LORD as the only one and His name the only one

Cll the land will change into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of
Jerusalem but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from
 Benjamins Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate
and from the Tower of Hananel to the kings wine presses

11Deople will live in it and no longer will a curse exist for Jerusalem will
dwell in security

2Now this will constitute the plague with which the LORD will strike all the
peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem their flesh will rot while
they stand on their feet and their eyes will rot in their sockets and their
tongue will rot in their mouth

21t will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on
them and they will 44sejze one anothers hand and the hand of one will
lift against the hand of another

1446Judah also will fight at Jerusalem and the wealth of all the
surrounding nations will accumulate gold and silver and garments in great
abundance

15So also like this plague will come the plague on the horse the mule
the camel the donkey and all the cattle that dwell in those camps

Then it will come about that any who remain of all the nations that went
against Jerusalem will Ego up from year to year to worship the King the
LORD of hosts and to celebrate the Feast of Booths

7And it will come to pass that whichever of the families of the earth does
not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King the LORD of hosts will
receive no rain

81f the family of Egypt does not go up or enter then no rain will fall on
them it will constitute the plague with which the LORD smites the nations
who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths

This people will know as the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of
all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths

2Tn that day people will inscribe on the bells of the horses 2HOLY TO
THE LORD  And the cooking pots in the LORDS house will resemble the
bowls before the altar

2lEvery cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will become holy to the
LORD of hosts and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in
 them And there will no longer dwell a Canaanite in the house of the LORD
of hosts in that day

Gods Love for Jacob
The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi

T have loved you says the LORD But you say How have You loved
us Did not Jacob have a brother Esau  declares the LORD Yet I have
loved Jacob

3but I have hated Esau and I have made his mountains a desolation and
appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness

Though Edom says We have received ruin but we will return and build
up the ruins thus says the LORD of hosts They may build but I will
tear down and men will call them the wicked territory and the people
toward whom the LORD maintains His indignity forever

Your eyes will see this and you will say The LORD has become
magnifies beyond the border of Israel

Sin of the Priests

 a son honors his father and a servant his master Then if you consider
me a father where is My honor And if you consider me a master why dont
you respect me says the LORD of hosts to you O priests who despise My
name But you say How have we despised Your name

7You present defiled food upon My altar But you say How have we
defiled You In that you say We have despised the  table of the LORD

SBut when you present the blind for sacrifice do you not do that with an
evil motive And when you present the lame and sick do you not do it with
an evil motive Why not offer it to your governor Would he take
 satisfaction with you Or would he receive you kindly says the LORD of
hosts

But now will you not entreat Gods favor that He may show
graciousness to us With such an offering on your part will He receive any
of you kindly says the LORD of hosts

10Oh if only someone among you would shut the gates that you might
not uselessly kindle fire on My altar I take no pleasure with you says the
LORD of hosts nor will I accept an offering from you

MEor from the rising of the sun even to its setting The nations will
exalt my name among the nations and in every place They will offer
incense in My name and offer a pure grain offering for the nations will
glorify My name says the LORD of hosts

12But you profane it in that you say The table of the Lord looks defiled
and as for its fruit we despise its food

3Vvou also say My how tiresome we find it And you disdainfully sniff
at it says the LORD of hosts and you bring what you took by robbery
and what has become lame or sick so you bring the offering Should I
receive that from your hand says the LORD

44But God curses the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it
but sacrifices a  blemished animal to the Lord for I have demonstrated
myself a great King says the LORD of hosts and the nations fear My
name

Priests to Receive Discipline

and now I give this commandment to you O priests

If you do not listen and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to
My name says the LORD of hosts then I will send the curse upon you

and I will curse your blessings and indeed I have cursed them already
because you do not take it to heart

3Behold I will rebuke your offspring and I will spread refuse on your
faces the refuse of your feasts and you will become overwhelmed by it
 Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you that My
Seovenant may continue with Levi says the LORD of hosts

My covenant with him gave life and peace and I gave them to him as
an object of reverence so he revered Me and stood in awe of My name

SOTrue instruction came from his mouth and unrighteousness did not light
on his lips he walked with Me in peace and uprightness and he turned
many back from iniquity

7For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge and men should
seek instruction from his mouth for he serves as the messenger of the
LORD of hosts

8But as for you you have turned aside from the way you have caused
many to stumble by the instruction you have corrupted the covenant of
Levi says the LORD of hosts

So 1 also have made you despised and abased before all the people
just as you do not keep My ways but show partiality in the instruction

Sin in the Family

10 we not all have Wone father Has not one God created us Why do
we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the
covenant of our fathers

IJudah has dealt treacherously and Israel has committed an
abomination throughout the land and in Jerusalem for Judah has profaned
the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves and has married the daughter of a
foreign god

12As for the man who does this may the LORD cut off from the tents of
Jacob everyone who awakes and answers or who presents an offering to
the LORD of hosts

3Eurthermore you cover the altar of the LORD with tears with weeping
and with groaning because He 4Qn0 longer regards the offering or accepts
it with favor from your hand

14Vet you say For what reason Because the LORD has served as a
witness between you and the 2 wife of your youth against whom you have
dealt treacherously though she has faithfully served as your companion
and your wife by covenant
 SBut not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit And what did
that one do while he sought 4S godly offspring Take heed then to your
spirit and let no one deal 44 treacherously against the wife of his youth

16For I hate divorce says the LORD the God of Israel and him who
covers his garment with wrong says the LORD of hosts So take heed to
your spirit that you do not deal treacherously

7ou have wearied the LORD with your words Yet you say How have
we wearied Him In that you say Everyone who does evil does good in
the sight of the LORD and He delights in them or Where can we
find the God of justice

The Purifier

1 Behold I will send My messenger and he will clear the way before
Me And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple and the
messenger of the covenant in whom you delight behold He comes says
the LORD of hosts

2But who can endure the day of His coming And who can stand when He
appears For He resembles a refiners fire and fullers soap

3He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver and He will purify the sons
of Levi and refine them like gold and silver so that they may present to
the LORD offerings in righteousness

Then the Lord will find the offering of Judah and Jerusalem pleasing as
in the days of old and as in former years

Then I will draw near to you for judgment and I will swiftly witness
against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who
swear falsely and against those who oppress the wage earner in his
wages the widow and the orphan and those who turn aside the alien
and do not fear Me says the LORD of hosts
 SFor I the LORD do not change therefore I have not consumed you O
sons of Jacob

7Erom the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes
and have not kept them Return to Me and I will return to you says the
LORD of hosts But you say How shall we return

You Have Robbed God

Swill a man rob God Yet you rob Me But you say How have we robbed
You In tithes and offerings

T Weurse you with a curse for you rob Me the whole nation of you

10 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that I may have food in
My house and test Me now in this says the LORD of hosts if I will not
open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing
until it overflows

1Then I will rebuke the devourer for you so that it will not destroy the
fruits of the ground nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes says the
LORD of hosts

1244 all the nations will call you blessed for you shall have a delightful
land says the LORD of hosts

3vour words have been arrogant against Me says the LORD Yet you
say What have we spoken against You

14vou have said We consider it vain to serve God and what profit
do we have in keeping His charge and that we have walked in mourning
before the LORD of hosts

1SSo now we call the arrogant blessed not only have the doers of
wickedness built themselves up but they also test God and escape

The Book of Remembrance

6Then those who lfeared the LORD spoke to one another and the LORD
49gave attention and heard it and His servants wrote a book of
remembrance before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His
name
 17They will become Mine says the LORD of hosts on the day that I
prepare My own possession and I will spare them as a man spares his
own son who serves him

8So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked
between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him

arrogant and every evildoer will become chaff and the day that comes
will set them ablaze says the LORD of hosts so that it will leave them
neither root nor branch

2But for you who fear My name the sun of righteousness will rise with
healing in its wings and you will go forth and skip about like calves from
the stall

3You will tread down the wicked for they will become ashes under the
soles of your feet on the day which I prepare says the LORD of hosts

4QRemember the law of Moses My servant even the statutes and
ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel

Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great
and terrible day of the LORD

He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts
of the children to their fathers so that I will not come and smite the land
with a curse
